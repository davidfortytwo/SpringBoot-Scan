# ‚úàÔ∏è 1. Tool Overview

During routine penetration testing, we often encounter microservices built with Spring Boot. This inspired the creation of an open-source penetration framework specifically for Spring Boot, primarily used for scanning sensitive information leakage endpoints and directly testing for high-risk vulnerabilities related to Spring. Thus, the tool **SpringBoot-Scan** (abbreviated as "SB-Scan") was developed.

**Current tool version: V2.51-2024/05/19**

**I have also compiled a guide on Spring Boot penetration techniques on my personal blog. Feel free to check it out and exchange ideas: [https://blog.zgsec.cn/archives/129.html](https://blog.zgsec.cn/archives/129.html)**

## Feature Support Updates

* [x] Thanks to [`@Viking`](https://github.com/VK2000), added more content to the `Dir.txt` sensitive endpoints dictionary
* [x] Thanks to [`@Fkalis`](https://github.com/FFR66), used `aiohttp` for concurrent batch information leakage scanning, significantly speeding up the `-uf` parameter

* [x] Added support for custom query statements when exporting asset mappings
* [x] Added delay scanning during sensitive endpoint brute force to prevent being blocked due to fast scanning speed

* [x] Added [Fofa asset mapping](https://fofa.info/) export module, automatically interfacing with the API to export assets to `fofaout.txt`
* [x] Added [ZoomEye asset mapping](https://www.zoomeye.org/) export module, automatically interfacing with the API to export assets to `zoomout.txt`
* [x] Filtering out some invalid echo pages during Spring endpoint brute force, improving work efficiency
* [x] Optimized the endpoint brute force dictionary, added some bypass statements (feel free to submit any additions)
* [x] Automatic fingerprint recognition for Spring
* [x] Output errors to `error.log` in the vulnerability exploitation module
* [x] Support for using authenticated HTTP proxy nodes, automatically checking node status
* [x] GUI version created by `@13exp`
* [x] Verify proxy availability, support using HTTP/HTTPS proxy for all traffic
* [x] Random User-Agent request headers
* [x] Resolve SSL certificate issues (use `http://` for self-signed certificates)
* [x] Intelligent target address recognition (e.g., `example.com`, `http://example.com/`, and `http://example.com` are all accepted without error)

## Notes

- **This tool enhances user experience by accepting `example.com`, `http://example.com/`, and `http://example.com` without error. The program will automatically identify and process these formats.**
- **SSL certificate issues have been resolved, allowing scans on Spring Boot frameworks using SSL certificates (use `http://` for self-signed certificates).**
- **For Spring projects deployed in subdirectories, simply provide the corresponding path to the tool (e.g., if `example.com/test/` deploys a Spring project, pass `example.com/test/` as the parameter to the tool).**

**GUI version created by [`@13exp`](https://github.com/13exp/), available at: [https://github.com/13exp/SpringBoot-Scan-GUI](https://github.com/13exp/SpringBoot-Scan-GUI)**

![GUI](./pic/GUI.png)

**Note: Both the main project `vul.py` and the GUI project contain vulnerability exploitation modules. It's normal for antivirus software to flag them. If you find the tool useful, consider giving it a star, haha!**

# üõ∏ 5. Tool Demonstration

## 0# Spring Asset Mapping

### Asset Mapping via ZoomEye

This tool interfaces with the [ZoomEye API](https://www.

zoomeye.org/doc), allowing you to batch download Spring asset mapping data using the API key:
```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -z <ZoomEye API-KEY>
```

![ZoomEye](./pic/ZoomEye.png)

**Note: This module now supports custom syntax for asset mapping export; the results will be exported to `zoomout.txt` after the asset mapping is complete, and you can use other parameters for operations.**

### Asset Mapping via Fofa

This tool interfaces with the [Fofa API](https://fofa.info/api), allowing you to batch download Spring asset mapping data using the API key:
```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -f <Fofa API-KEY>
```

![Fofa](./pic/Fofa.png)

**Note: This module now supports custom syntax for asset mapping export; the results will be exported to `fofaout.txt` after the asset mapping is complete, and you can use other parameters for operations.**

### Asset Mapping via Hunter

This tool interfaces with the [Hunter API](https://hunter.qianxin.com/home/helpCenter?r=5-1-2), allowing you to batch download Spring asset mapping data using the API key:
```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -y <Hunter API-KEY>
```

![Hunter](./pic/Hunter.png)

**Note: This module now supports custom syntax for asset mapping export; the results will be exported to `hunterout.txt` after the asset mapping is complete, and you can use other parameters for operations.**

## 1# Testing and Using Proxy and Custom HTTP Headers

### Testing and Using Proxy

```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -p <proxy IP:port>
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -p <HTTP auth username:HTTP auth password@proxy IP:port>
```

![Test Proxy](./pic/ÊµãËØï‰ª£ÁêÜ.png)

For example, to scan a single URL for information leakage using a proxy:
```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -u example.com -p <proxy IP:port>
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -p <HTTP auth username:HTTP auth password@proxy IP:port>
```
Similarly, other parameters (`-u` / `-uf` / `-v` / `-vf` / `-d`) can be used with a proxy.

### Testing and Using Custom HTTP Headers

```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -t header.txt
```

![Headers](./pic/Headers.png)

To use this custom HTTP header feature, modify the contents of `header.txt` accordingly. This feature supports the (`-u` / `-uf` / `-v` / `-d`) parameters. Batch vulnerability scanning does not have a clear need for this feature, so it was not included.

## 2# Brute Forcing Sensitive Endpoints for a Single URL

`Dir.txt` is a built-in Spring endpoint brute force dictionary. It contains most sensitive information leakage endpoints related to Spring Boot.

If there are any omissions, feel free to contact me.

```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -u example.com
```

![Scan Single URL](./pic/Êâ´ÊèèÂçï‰∏ÄURL.png)

Added delay scanning option; if you do not want delay scanning, enter `0` and press Enter.

**Note: Successful results will be exported to `urlout.txt` in the same directory.**

## 3# Reading Target TXT for Batch Information Leakage Scanning

```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -uf url.txt
```

![Batch Scan from TXT](./pic/ËØªÂèñTXTÂπ∂ÊâπÈáèÊâ´Êèè.png)

Added delay scanning option; if you do not want delay scanning, enter `0` and press Enter. Thanks to [`@Fkalis`](https://github.com/FFR66), added concurrent scanning option, with a default concurrency of 10.

**Note: Due to version updates, the parameter for reading TXT and scanning has been changed to `uf` from version 2.21 onwards. Successful results will be exported to `output.txt` in the same directory.**

## 4# Exploiting Vulnerabilities in a Single URL

```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -v example.com
```

![Exploit Single URL](./pic/ÂØπÂçï‰∏ÄURLËøõË°åÊºèÊ¥ûÂà©Áî®.png)

Implemented RCE vulnerability and command customization feature (don't use it for bad purposes).

**More built-in modules for vulnerability exploitation will be added in the future, so stay tuned!**

## 5# Reading Target TXT for Batch Vulnerability Scanning

```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -vf url.txt
```

![Poc](./pic/Poc.png)

You can freely select vulnerabilities from the vulnerability library for batch verification. Successful results will be exported to `vulout.txt`.

## 6# Scanning and Downloading SpringBoot Sensitive Files

```
python3 SpringBoot-Scan.py -d example.com
```

![Scan and Download Sensitive Files](./pic/Êâ´ÊèèÂπ∂‰∏ãËΩΩSpringBootÊïèÊÑüÊñá‰ª∂.png)

**Note: Scanned sensitive files will be automatically downloaded to the script's running directory, with a progress bar showing real-time download progress.**

Currently, the built-in sensitive file directories include:
```
actuator/heapdump
gateway/actuator/heapdump
heapdump
heapdump.json
hystrix.stream
artemis-portal/artemis/heapdump
```

If you know of other sensitive file directories, please submit an issue. Thank you!
